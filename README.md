# A simple TCP server in C++
This repository showcases the basic dependencies necessary to start a TCP server in C++.
The source code is still under development and will not work.
The code in this repository currently has been inherited from a lot of sources more specifically here [1]. The goal of this
repository is to benchmark an appropriate library for my backtesting application. I am currently 
stuck between boost.asio and WS2tcpip and am trying to figure out which one will suit the best for my purpose.

TODO:
1.Add client side module.
